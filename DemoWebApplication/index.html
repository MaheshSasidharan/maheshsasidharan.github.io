It was because of you that our team was happy.<br /><br />You are a prodigy for a great manager who showed that a Manager's work is not just to take all work items from Redmond and throw it on to team members, but also to ensure your team members were content and relaxed.

                           <strong>Project 1</strong> - First project. Thought it was just migration. Thought it would be a smooth sail. My thoughts were wrong. MOM, Huddle, Status update, TFS, certification, learning mail, communication sessions. Got introduced to these gatecrashers, got accustomed, survived.<br />
                           <br />
                           <strong>Project 2</strong> - Having aversion to frontend technology, the day I was assigned to Project 2, I went running to Amrish, pleading him to put me anywhere but SharePoint. That obviously did not help. But Amrish, thanks a ton. Had you accepted my request then I would have had to somehow put this farewell mail in DB and write stored procedures and execute with SSIS package (which if Piyush reviews, then HudHud would have been the least of my worries). In this project, I got to see people in night shift, and made new friends. Megha being sweet darling she is, Mumbai never felt geographically far as I could always talk with my Manager freely for anything.<br />
                           <br />
                           <strong>Project 3</strong> - Masti sae bhara team with two best Managers - Nitin and Lokenath, there was nothing more I could ask for. Had to frequently irk Srikanth, Kavya, Venky and Srikar for Business knowledge, chat with clients (including one Mr. Mohammed Hasoun) was mind blasting (literally). Time pass kae liyae ek app banaya. And it seems that helped me get into my next project.<br />
                           <br />
                           <strong>Project 4</strong> - Originally joined as a temporary replacement for a maximum of 10 days, Migration became synonymous for Oxygen for me for the next 6 months (6*30 != 10). But undoubtedly this was the best thing that happened to me. Learnt A LOT. More importantly, with Murtuza and Arnab along with lot of bachalogs in team, this was by far the best time I had in MAQ. We were the only team jo lot of bakar-bakar kartae thae (disturbing entire ODC), but end of the day got the work done (with bugs of course, but status update mein green jaata tha, and fixed them by next morning). On August 15th, when India was celebrating her independence, we were laying down the framework of our constituti…. wait, wrong dialogue, we laying down the final pieces of bug fixes and thereafter witnessed the smoothest migration ever (as described by Vishal during QPU) (ok come down from cloud 9 Mahesh, this appreciation will not help you with your KRA since you've lost employee benefits the day you put down your papers). All the extra saturdays, extra hours, morning 1am ko team bike mein lift, everything paid off. Was promoted to SE-2 cause of this (Either this, or Amrish could not afford to spend time explaining how I was among top performers, but ratings had been normalized) :-D<br />
                           <br />
                           <strong>Project 5</strong> - Mere liyae Migration (with SharePoint) tho Maa hain, but Project 5 (with advanced SharePoint) tho Baap nikla. With maharathis like Pratik and Sagar along with super talented cum hard working people ready to sacrifice Saturday, Sunday, election day, din ya raat for this critical project for MAQ, Project 5 surely seems to be in safe hands. Hope this will help get more projects for MAQ.

                           <strong>Arun</strong> and <strong>Wilson</strong> - I always wanted to work in your team. Though initially because getting good ratings seemed easy under you, showing that you value every effort made by your team members, but later on, mostly for the fun, chilled out yet committed managers that you are. I might not have had this migraine had I ever gotten to work with you guys.<br /><br />
                           Lokenath, though I could not work much with you, but I never really needed to. You are the awesomest person I have met at MAQ. Wise, understanding, down-to-earth, cool, simple and fill other adjectives here…….

                           Out of all the spot awards and appreciations over these two years, I value the <strong>TT Addict</strong> award the most. I had really worked hard for this achievement and this is one of the main talents I can confidently say I have gained at MAQ.

                               At MAQ, I was lucky to have great mentors and POCs and leads and Managers and collegues and..(aur kaun bacha hai!) Many of them helped my better myself in several ways. Those people show traits of <b>Leadership</b> as mentioned <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/simon_sinek_why_good_leaders_make_you_feel_safe#t-404746" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/video.php?v=580833165379740" target="_blank">here</a>.<br />

                               One thing that people want in life is simply, respect. If you hurt someone by disrespecting that person, then you lack a trait that is fundamental to being human being. Everyone deserves this respect, your juniors, colleagues, friends and seniors. The only people who don’t deserve this respect is the one who lacks this fundamental trait.

                               Having had witnessed several parties and team outings, I have seen many treat a waiter like he is paid for listening to your harsh words or for that matter when you roll your eyes in disbelief when a security guard asks you to show your ID card (which he is does to ensure Your safety). Why does saving those 5 seconds become something critical for your survival?<br />
                               <br />
                               Surely there might have been some gaps, or their rules might be questionable, or in worst case, he could have been disrespectful himself. But <i>the locus of control is with you</i> &copy;. I have seen many people lose control and shout at someone who is of a lower stature than him, yet gladly embracing barb from their boss without battering an eye. So do one thing, try treating everyone, even your subordinates like your boss, give them that fake respect, and then see how your image as a pretentious twat gives way to one with a respectable persona.<br />
                               <br />
                               A simple case with all of the above scenarios can be seen <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/pay-it-forward-couple-leave-100-tip-to-waiter-for-pretty-terrible-service-9764405.html" target="_blank">here</a>.
                               I don’t expect you to be kind through money, just Respect would do. You might not have liked the food\service\ambience\chaddi too tight\fan speed or whatever first world problems you’d have, just don’t put that frustration on someone who is trying to earn his livelihood with such meagre compensation, and simply don’t go there from next time onwards.

                               There are two kinds of success in this world. Professional and Personal. Professional is just too abstract. Money is not all that matters. There are successful entrepreneurs and CEOs I know of who are professionally successful but are aversed by others. Take <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump">Donald Trump</a> for instance, rich as rich could be defined, yet invokes a sense of dread and unease when faced with (and he is a Republican. So you know they don't think much).
                               <br /><br />
                               Money is important, but how much is something you have to set because before you know you’d have earned enough just to pass it on to your heir and then you die. :\ People can get rich even by selling tomatoes or a crappy game like Flappy Bird(still don’t know how that got viral). Personal success is when you achieve what you want to, and not what the society defines for you. MKG could have been a rich lawyer, but he became an immortal hero. He succeeded in his life. Bhagat singh succeeded in his life. Malala succeeded in her life. Kailash Satyarthi succeeded in his life. A father/mother who has given decent education to his/her child, has succeeded in life. If that Satisfies you, then that is all you need to do be called a Successful person.<br />
                               <br />
                               Rich != Successful Life<br />
                               Satisfaction = Successful Life

                               I have talked with many people here who are pessimistic about your technical or communication skills. Let me emancipate by telling you that YOU WILL be strong enough to feel secure within an year if not few months. Everyone I know of in this company is simply great. Now you might be weak in something, but very soon you can be better than the person who taught you. Everyone has different pace, and the best part, MAQ understands that. So in case your lead or PM calls you and says you have to improve, then just up-shift your gear and take that extra mile, and within next few months, they will call you to solve their issues. I seriously mean EVERYONE of you. So take a chill pill. Because things will get better. Just don’t forget to relish your life in between.

And <a href="http://donatelifeindia.org" target="_blank">this</a> is how you can do it. I can share videos on how a simple donation has helped save\alter someone’s life, but that is just a simple <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HuKx2a5HkIM">YouTube</a> search away. Please give up on superstitions already, or fear looking ugly after your death, or fear of not having your organs when you ascend to respective religion’s heaven, because that is just plain ignorance. And if not before your death, then at least after it you can be sure you will become a true human being.<br /><br />
                               Also, for all the great people who donated whatever they could for Arpit Agarwal, please take a bow, for despite not being millionaires you guys did what heros do. People like you really are amazing and gives me the satisfaction that in case something happens to me, or you or your friends, your family will have one less thing to worry about.

                               I know being religious gives a sense of hope, but praying everyday to see a shooting star for years and witnessing one after 58 years is not because your prayers were heard, it’s called probability.<br /><br />
                               Life is much more complicated and appreciative when you try to understand the <i>hows</i> and <i>whys</i> rather than <i>‘oh choo-mantar, that’s why’</i>. Religion tried to answer complicated things like life and purpose, but with time, science found more believable answers.<br /><br />
                               I know I sound just like a regular evangelist from a regular faith. But Science is not regular. If A says the Earth is at the center of universe, and B says otherwise, then science accepts only that argument which is more palpable.<br /><br />
                               So don’t waste this life trying to find a piece of bread which resembles you religious symbol, rather try to understand how that bread was made - right from electrons and atoms to heating in the oven and ready to eat form.
